Description: Functions for performing canonical correlation analysis via 
    reduced-rank regression with support for regularization and cross-validation. 
    Several methods for estimating CCA in high-dimensional settings are implemented. The first set of methods, cca_rrr (and variants), assumes that one dataset is high-dimensional
    and the other is low-dimensional, while the second, ecca (for Efficient CCA) assumes that both datasets are high-dimensional.
    For both methods, standard l1 regularization as well as group-lasso regularization are available. cca_graph_rrr further supports total variation regularization
    when there is a known graph structure among the variables of the high-dimensional dataset. In this case, the loadings of the canonical directions of the high-dimensional dataset are assumed 
    to be smooth on the graph.
